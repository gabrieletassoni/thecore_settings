App settings editable via RailsAdmin with support for ActiveRecord and Mongoid.

Supports images, files, html with or without sanitization, code with codemirror, etc.

## Features

- Lazy loading - loads settings only if they are needed during request
- Loads all settings at once and caches them for the duration of request
- Supports lots of setting kinds - yaml, html with ckeditor, phone numbers etc
- Each setting can be enabled and disabled within rails_admin, if it's disabled it returns default value for kind

## Installation

1. Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    ```shell
    gem 'thecore_settings'
    ```

2. Then migrate:

    ```shell
    rails db:migrate
    ```


### OPTIONAL Generage migration 

Not needed anymore since migrations from this gem are automatically loaded by main app when needed:

    ```shell
    rails g thecore_settings:migration
    ```

## Gemfile order matters

- Put it after rails_admin to get built-in support
- Put it after rails_admin_toggleable to get built-in support
- Put it after ckeditor/glebtv-ckeditor/rich to get built-in support
- Put it after russian_phone to get built-in support
- Put it after sanitized to get built-in support
- Put it after safe_yaml to get built-in support
- Put it after validates_email_format_of to get built-in support
- Put it after geocoder to get built-in support
- Put it after carrierwave / paperclip to get built-in support
- Put it after addressable to get built-in support

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install thecore_settings

## Basic Usage (like RailsSettings)

    Settings.admin_email = 'test@example.com'
    Settings.admin_email


## Advanced Usage

    Settings.content_block_1(kind: 'html', default: 'test', label: "Test Value")
    Settings.data(kind: 'yaml')
    Settings.data = [1, 2, 3]

    Settings.enabled?(:phone, kind: 'phone', default: '906 111-11-11') # also creates setting if it doesn't exist
    Settings.phone.area
    Settings.phone.subscriber

See more here: https://github.com/rs-pro/thecore_settings/blob/master/spec/advanced_usage_spec.rb

## Namespacing

Settings can have namespaces (useful for locale, etc)

    Settings.ns('test').s1 = 123
    Settings.ns('test').s1
    > "123"
    Settings.ns('main').s1
    > ""
    Settings.s1
    > ""
    Settings.ns_default = 'test'
    Settings.s1
    > "123"
    Settings.ns_default = 'main'
    Settings.ns_fallback = 'test'
    Settings.s1
    > "123"


## Value types

Supported types:

    string (input)
    text (textarea)
    boolean (checkbox)
    color (uses built-in RailsAdmin color picker)
    html (does NOT sanitize (allows ANY javascript) - for trusted admin, supports Rich, glebtv-ckeditor, ckeditor, but does not require any of them)
    code (does NOT sanitize (allows ANY javascript) - shows as codemirror, requires glebtv-ckeditor for codemirror)
    sanitized (requires sanitize gem -- sanitizes HTML before saving to DB [Warning: uses RELAXED config!])
    integer (stored as string)
    yaml (requires safe_yaml)
    phone (requires russian_phone)
    phones (requires russian_phone - multiple phones)
    email (requires validates_email_format_of)
    address (requires geocoder)
    file (requires paperclip or carrierwave)
    url (requires addressable)
    domain (requires addressable)
    sanitize (uses rails sanitize helper with default settings, shows as html)
    sanitize_code (uses rails sanitize helper with default settings, shows as codemirror textarea, can provide custom scrubber, defaults to Rails::Html::WhiteListSanitizer)
    strip_tags (uses strip_tags rails helper)
    simple_format (uses simple_format rails helper)
    simple_format_raw (does NOT sanitize (allows ANY javascript) - uses simple_format rails helper with sanitize: false)
    json

#### Sanitize settings

Sanitizer can be changed like this:
```
RalsAdminSettings.scrubber = Rails::Html::WhiteListSanitizer.new
```
defaults to Rails::Html::WhiteListSanitizer

Strings and html support following replacement patterns:

    {{year}} -> current year
    {{year|2013}} -> 2013 in 2013, 2013-2014 in 2014, etc

Sanitized types sanitize before storing to DB and not on display for performance.
Simple format types are stored in db as-is.

## Usage with Rails Admin

Rails admin management for settings is supported out of the box

It is recommended to disable new/create page (it is not supported by design, settings are defined in ruby code).
Disable via cancan:

```
cannot :create, ThecoreSettings::Setting
```
